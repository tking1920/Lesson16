        <p>Gallery X is an imaginary gallery, created for the purposes of this web typography exercise. If it did
            exist, it would be dedicated to showcasing type and lettering through the ages. While web 
            typographers work in HTML and CSS, our craft is built upon the fundation created by letteres, 
            printers, typographers, and type designers who came before us. </p>

        <h3><em>Filippo Tommaso Marinetti</em></h3>
        <p>Opening January 28, 2017</p> 
        <p>Carnegie Gallery</p> 
        <p>An Italian poet, editor, art theorist, fascist, and founder of the Futurist movement, Marinetti 
        declared in his manifesto: "Courage, audacity, and revolt will be the essential elements of our 
        poetry..We will destroy the museums, libraries, academies of every kind...We affirm that the 
        world's magnificence has been enriched by a new beauty: the beauty of speed." He promoted a new
        kind of poetry, enhancing the expressive power of his writing with a loose construction of words. 
        Influenced by his experience as a reporter in the Balkan conflict in 1912-13, much of Marinetti's 
        work conveyed osmething of the emotional tone or sensation of war.</p>
